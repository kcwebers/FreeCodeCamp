Some thoughts after completing the arrays section. 

Although this course does a very good job of introducting the datastructures and concepts, I think it moves through them rather fast.

One good example of this is `console.log()`, which is the very first thing that is introduced, but it is not integrated to any of the following sections for the actual assignments. I think it would be good to add the `console.log()` for the actual code test portion as it would force the user to utilize the command, constantly illustrating how it functions. It is also a good way to ensure that people are actually running the code locally instead of randomly punching in solutions and hoping they will work.
The `console.log()` command also helps for the user to understand the assignment of variables and how they are modified overtime.

It's understandable that people might not have a set up means for running the code locally, but I feel it would be an important first step to introduce people to running things either through a online source like jsbin, repl.it, or something similar. Alternatively, you can have people run it via their local terminal, but that is always a touch risky ðŸ˜¬.
