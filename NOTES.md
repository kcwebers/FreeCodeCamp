## Some thoughts after completing the arrays section. 

Although this course does a very good job of introducting the datastructures and concepts, I think it moves through them rather fast.

One good example of this is `console.log()`, which is the very first thing that is introduced, but it is not integrated to any of the following sections for the actual assignments. I think it would be good to add the `console.log()` for the actual code test portion as it would force the user to utilize the command, constantly illustrating how it functions. It is also a good way to ensure that people are actually running the code locally instead of randomly punching in solutions and hoping they will work.
The `console.log()` command also helps for the user to understand the assignment of variables and how they are modified overtime.

It's understandable that people might not have a set up means for running the code locally, but I feel it would be an important first step to introduce people to running things either through a online source like jsbin, repl.it, or something similar. Alternatively, you can have people run it via their local terminal, but that is always a touch risky ðŸ˜¬.

## After functions section

I think a better approach to discussing Data Types and Data Structures is to introduce the consepts themselves early on.

You can open up by introducing Data Types and Data Structures broadly, briefly noting the difference between the 2, then delve deeper into the simpler of the two and gradually progress to the complicated aspects of either or both. Establishing early on how there's several different items that fall ounder these 2 umbrellas can help coding newbies to categorize types and structures that are introduced later on. Making a reference point like this can help people organize more foreign concepts that they may not fully understand.

Basically think of it like this: we created a few filing cabinets into which we can files many files. For example, we can make Data Types, Data Structures, Keywords, etc. Into these we can file concepts like string, number, boolean, array, function, var, let, object, etc. Without those overarching filing cabinets, each new sub-concept can feel overwhelming and unruly, like files that are just strewn everywhere. Knowing that you can AT LEAST file a new concept into a specific category can help establish a reference point that you can build forward from.

Not sure if that lil metaphor made sense, but that's what I'm thinking. 

I think FreeCodeCamp does an excellent job of 'building' forward in certain ways, but it does so in a simple way that deos not lend itself to long term knowledge. It basically feels like it's optomised to push peopel through the course instead of build a comprehensive basework of knowledge. I understand that overloading concepts on a newcomer can be overwhelming, but it is necessary if people want to actually develop their skills in a meaningful way.
