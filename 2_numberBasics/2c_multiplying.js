We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

// Original
// const product = 8 * 0;

const product = 8 * 10;
console.log(product);
