**This is a free course that is provided online that I wanted to work through and chronicle here! I have taught algos and been an instructor for fullstack application written in Python (Flask & Django/MySQL), Javascript (MEAN/MERN/Mongoose), and Java (STS/MySQL). My goal for going through this course is to see how the same concept I know are taught and see how I can better my translating of simple or complex ideas can be improved.**
