# Follow Along with FreeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
### https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/

**I wanted to work through this free online course and chronicle here! I have taught algos and been an instructor for fullstack web applications written in Python (Flask & Django/MySQL), Javascript (MEAN/MERN/Mongoose), and Java (STS/MySQL). My goal for going through this course is to see how the same concepts I know are taught elsewhere, and see how my translating of simple or complex ideas can be improved.**
