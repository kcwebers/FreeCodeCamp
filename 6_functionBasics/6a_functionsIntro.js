Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function.
=================================================================*/

// Solution (no Original)

// 1. Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
function reusableFunction() {
    console.log("Hi World");
}

// 2. Call the function.
reusableFunction();

// Personal Notes
// =================================================================
/*
- I would talk more about 'wrappers' and how the scope of a function works
- This would help with later sections discussing things like loops and if statements

- talk about how the parantheses can contain parameters? 
- maybe a more thorough intro to what a function is, as opposed to just an example

- Can refer to console.log() as an example of a reusable piece of javascript code that you can call!
- talk about keywords? ie. var, let, const, function, etc.
